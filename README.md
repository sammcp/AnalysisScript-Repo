#Script to analyise data gained from test participants from the game 

Notes: 

-   Currently using global variables instead of fucntion passing, not best practice but fine for this small script 

-   Numpy Needed 

- Possible Improvements: 

    -   Vizuliation of results 
    -   Standard Deviation of certain values ? 
    -   Updating a Baysian learning technique could be cool, analysing  
        each set of data as it came in and using it to calculate a new posterior ?
